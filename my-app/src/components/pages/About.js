            <p>I am a second year interior design student at SCC and will be graduating with an Associates degree Fall 2023. In 2014 I graduated from U of A with a Bachelor’s in Accounting.</p>
            <p>When 2020 hit, I quit my job, eloped, moved into a van, and traveled around the country with my husband for a year. It was during this time that I realized how unhappy I was in my accounting career. Although I am very business/logic-minded, my inner creative voice was screaming. I decided to take the leap and go back to school for the dream that had always been on the distant horizon - interior design. I’ve never felt happier or more excited about what I am doing!</p>
            <p>My true passion lies with hospitality, however, I look forward to learning more about this industry from both a commercial and residential aspect. I am open to opportunity wherever it may arise!</p>
            <p>I am based in Chandler, AZ. For inquiries, feel free to contact me below.</p>
